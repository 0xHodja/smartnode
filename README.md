`Rocket Pool 2.0` is a next generation Ethereum proof of stake (PoS) infrastructure service designed to be highly decentralised, distributed and compatible with Casper 2.0, the new consensus protocol that Ethereum will transition to in late 2019.

This repository contains the Smart Node package required to run a Smart Node in the Rocket Pool network and earn a higher return staking ether than you would outside the network.

# Package

The Smart Node package allows a node operator to install all dependencies and begin running a full Rocket Pool Smart Node easily.

## CLI

The package contains a command line interface that will allow node operators to stake their own ether easily, monitor their nodes status and connect to the Rocket Pool network.

## Daemons

The package also contains several services that operate in the background called daemons. They monitor the beacon chain on the Ethereum network and also monitor the Rocket Pool network.
